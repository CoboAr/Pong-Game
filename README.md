# Pong-Game
An implementation of Pong game using turtle python library.
## How does it work?
The game is played between 2 players, Left Paddle and Right Paddle. Left Paddle moves up by pressing "w" key and down by pressing "s" key. Right Paddle moves up by pressin "Up" arrow key and down by pressing "Down" arrow key. When the ball hits the left wall, the Right Paddle scores and the game restarts. When the ball hits the right wall, the Left Paddle scores and the game restarts. Whenever the paddle hits the ball, the speed of ball increases.
